ðŸš€ **Excited to Announce: DockerRunKit API by CyberAliens!** ðŸš€

I hope to share our new API, DockerRunKit. First of all, we aim to make changes and provide solutions from CyberAliens. The main reason for this API is that CyberAliens hosts three competitions. The PWN and WEB challenges often experience downtime because all users use the same port for the same question. After our competition, Qays Sarayra and Abdulrahman Almeslamani, the CTO and CIO of CyberAliens and leaders of the ECCO team, searched for a solution.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**
- Manages VPS servers and allocates more resources dynamically.
- Allows each team to run challenges any time with unique ports assigned for each session.
- Built using FastAPI for robust performance.
- Checks for Docker images in DockerHub if they are not present in the environment.

ðŸ”¹ **How to Get Started:**
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/DockerRunKit.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the API: `nohup python3 app.py &`

Let's innovate and solve challenges together! ðŸš€
